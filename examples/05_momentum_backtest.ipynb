    "The class inherits from CustomFactor and specifies its inputs and the window length required for its computations. The inputs include the closing price of US equities (USEquityPricing.close) and the returns over a specified window length (126 trading days in this case). The window_length attribute is set to 252, which typically represents the number of trading days in a year. The compute method is where the core logic of the factor is implemented. This method is automatically called by Zipline with the necessary data aligned according to the specified inputs and window_length. The compute method calculates the momentum factor for each asset based on price changes over different periods: the change in price over the last 252 days (1 year) and the change over the last 21 days (1 month). This is then normalized by the standard deviation of returns over the specified period, to account for volatility. This normalization provides a relative measure of momentum, making it more comparable across different assets."

Within this pipeline, it incorporates a custom factor, MomentumFactor(), and a built-in factor, AverageDollarVolume(window_length=30). The pipeline is set up with four columns: \"factor\" holds the computed momentum values, \"longs\" and \"shorts\" represent the top and bottom assets based on momentum for a specified number of assets (N_LONGS and N_SHORTS), and \"ranking\" provides a rank of assets based on their momentum. We then use the built in AverageDollarVolume factor to set a screener to only include the top 500 assets by dollar volume."
